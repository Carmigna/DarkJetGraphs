# Jetgraphs
Tools for manipulating Jetgraphs. Jetgraphs are graphs built on top of physical processes. 

:grey_exclamation: this package is pip-installable! See `examples/JetGraphDataset_v5.1.ipynb` for a tutorial to download a dataset and start working with jetgraphs.

- `JetgraphDataset` lets you download a dataset of jetgraphs and manipulate them with a bunch of trasforms.
- `jetgraphs.utils` offers, among the others, some functions to pretty-plot Jetgraphs and visualize what you are doing.
- `jetgraphs.explainability` offers explainable AI tools. For now, we have Captum TracIn adjusted to work with pytorch geometric.
